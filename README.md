## Project Goal & Hypothesis
This dataset seeks to test whether error-related brain activity differs between socially anxious and non-anxious participants within an ecologically valid task context. Towards this end, we will assess error-related brain activity during a real-world golf task. 

We hypothesize that individuals with social anxiety will exhibit elevated error-related brain activity when making mistakes in the presence of others, whether on a traditional lab-based computer task or within an ecologically valid sports task.



## Design & Analysis
Participants will complete a set of questionnaires assessing social anxiety followed by a flanker task (assessing inhibitory control abilities) along with a golf putting task. Each task will be completed twice; once while alone (creating a “nonsocial context”) and once while being observed by the experimenter (creating a “social context”). We use EEG to assess error detection. 

The error-related negativity (ERN), and event-related potential (ERP) associated with error monitoring will be extracted following errors in both tasks, in both conditions (whether alone or under social observation). Additionally, we will perform regression-based analyses in MATLAB to test whether variation in social anxiety more strongly relates to either task in the social condition, and moreover, if there is an interaction between the tasks, such that a stronger relation is observed in the social setting vs non-social setting for one or both tasks.
